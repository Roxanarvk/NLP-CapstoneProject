Airbnb Review Sentiment Analysis 
	
	
	
There is no doubt that the rapid growth of Airbnb has changed the lodging industry and tourists’ behaviors. Airbnb welcomes customers and engages them by creating and providing unique travel experiences to “live like a local” through the delivery of lodging services. With the special experiences that Airbnb customers pursue, more investigation is needed to systematically examine the Airbnb customer lodging experience. Online reviews offer a representative look at individual customers’ personal and unique lodging experiences. Moreover, the overall ratings given by customers are reflections of their experiences with a product or service. Since customers take overall ratings into account in their purchase decisions, a study that bridges the customer lodging experience and the overall rating is needed. In contrast to traditional research methods, mining customer reviews has become a useful method to study customers’ opinions about products and services. Searching for homes is the primary mechanism guests use to find the place they want to book. Ranking at Airbnb is a quest to understand the needs of the guests and the quality of the hosts to strike the best match possible.
